        "description": "The ‚ÄòReturn to Sender‚Äô mission, which will be Rocket Lab‚Äôs 16th Electron launch, will lift-off from Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand‚Äôs MƒÅhia Peninsula. The 14-day launch window is scheduled to open on November 19 UTC, with lift-off scheduled between 01:44 - 04:34 UTC.\nRocket Lab‚Äôs Electron launch vehicle will loft 30 satellites to a sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km altitude for a range of customers, including TriSept, Unseenlabs, Swarm, Auckland Programme for Space Systems, and global gaming software company Valve. The satellites span a range of operations, from TriSept‚Äôs tech demonstration of new tether systems designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris, through to the next generation of maritime surveillance satellites for Unseenlabs, as well as communications satellites for Swarm. The mission will also deploy New Zealand‚Äôs first student-built satellite, the APSS-1 satellite for Te P≈´naha ƒÄtea - Auckland Space Institute at The University of Auckland.\nRocket Lab will also attempt to bring Electron‚Äôs first stage back to Earth under a parachute system for a controlled water landing before collection by a recovery vessel. It will be the first time Rocket Lab has attempted to recover a stage after launch and is a major milestone in Rocket Lab‚Äôs pursuit to make Electron a reusable rocket to support an increased launch cadence for small satellites.\n\nPayloads on board: \nPayload: DRAGRACER\nOrganization: TriSept\nThe DRAGRACER mission will test the effectiveness of new tether technologies designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris at the conclusion of space missions. TriSept has completed the integration of a pair of qualified Millennium Space Systems 6U small satellites, one featuring the tether drag device and one without. The controlled spacecraft should deorbit in approximately 45 days, while the second spacecraft is expected to remain in orbit for seven to nine years, according to Tethers Unlimited, developer of the 70-meter-long (230 feet) Terminator Tape aboard the control satellite.\n\nPayload: BRO-2 and BRO-3\nOrganization: Unseenlabs\nBRO-2 and BRO-3 are the second and third satellites in French company Unseenlabs‚Äô planned constellation of about 20 satellites dedicated to maritime surveillance. The first BRO satellite was launched to orbit by Rocket Lab in August 2019. Unseenlabs‚Äô constellation enables improved monitoring of activities at sea, such as illegal fishing and anti-environmental behavior. Thanks to a unique proprietary technology, the BRO satellites are the first to be able to independently and precisely locate and fingerprint Radio Frequency (RF) emitters all around the globe, day or night, in any weather condition, and without requiring any special embarked tracking device. With three satellites in orbit, Unseenlabs‚Äô clients can now benefit from the shortest revisit time available on the satellite RF geolocation market.\n\nPayload: APSS-1\nOrganization: Auckland Programme for Space Systems, The University of Auckland\nThe student-built Waka ƒÄmiorangi Aotearoa APSS-1 satellite is designed to monitor electrical activity in Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere to test whether ionospheric disturbances might be linked to earthquakes. The data from this mission will deliver deeper knowledge of these hard-to-access altitudes and drive understanding of how phenomena such as solar wind and geophysical events affect this atmospheric region.\n\nPayload: Spacebees\nOrganization: Swarm Technologies\nSwarm will launch the latest 24 1/4U SpaceBEE satellites to continue building out its planned constellation of 150 satellites to provide affordable satellite communications services to IoT devices in remote regions around the world. Swarm‚Äôs uniquely small satellites enable the company to provide network services and user hardware at the industry‚Äôs lowest cost and deliver maximum value to customers across a range of industries including maritime shipping, agriculture, energy, and ground transportation. The SpaceBEES will be integrated into two of Rocket Lab‚Äôs 3U Maxwell CubeSat dispensers for orbital deployment.\n\nMass Simulator: Gnome Chompski\nOrganization: Gabe Newell, Founder of Valve Software\nManufactured with support from multi-award-winning design studio Weta Workshop, the unique space component is additively manufactured from titanium and printed in the shape of Half-Life gaming icon Gnome Chompski. The mission serves as an homage to the innovation and creativity of gamers worldwide, and also aims to test and qualify a novel 3D printing technique that could be employed for future spacecraft components. The 150 mm gnome will remain attached to the Kick Stage during all mission phases and will burn up upon re-entry into Earth‚Äôs atmosphere during the de-orbiting process. \n\n(Rocket Lab)",

In the wake of the wildfires that devastated areas of the state in August, first responders there have been using the service for their purposes and to help bring the residents of Malden internet service while they rebuild their community. Malden is located about 35 miles south of Spokane, Washington, which falls within the northern latitudes our satellites currently service.  The way emergency responders deployed Starlink in this context is representative of how Starlink works best‚Äîin remote or rural areas where internet connectivity is unavailable.\n (Source: SpaceX)",

        "description": "The Mars 2020 mission with its Perseverance rover is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The Mars 2020 mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key Astrobiology questions about the potential for life on Mars. The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life itself. The Perseverance rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a 'cache' on the surface of Mars. A future mission could potentially return these samples  to Earth.  That would help scientists study the samples in laboratories with special room-sized equipment that would be too large to take to Mars. The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.\n\nThe mission is timed for a launch opportunity in July 2020 when Earth and Mars are in good positions relative to each other for landing on Mars. That is, it takes less power to travel to Mars at this time, compared to other times when Earth and Mars are in different positions in their orbits. To keep mission costs and risks as low as possible, the Mars 2020 design is based on NASA's successful Mars Science Laboratory mission architecture, including its Curiosity rover and proven landing system.\n\nLaunch is still on schedule and the Mars 2020 team is working hard to get the Perseverance rover to the launch pad.  Check the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex for hours and/or any restrictions.  If you plan to attend in person, consider making refundable travel reservations.\n\nThe first launch opportunity begins at 6:35 a.m. PDT/ 9:35 a.m. EDT on July 22\n\nThe launch period is approximately three weeks, from July 22 to August 11. The duration of the daily launch window varies from day to day. The launch windows will last approximately two hours, with a unique launch opportunity every five minutes.\n\nThe Mars 2020 spacecraft with its Perseverance Rover will launch on an Atlas V-541 rocket from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.  The Atlas V is one of the largest rockets available for interplanetary flight.  This is the same type of rocket that launched the InSight and Curiosity to Mars.  The launch vehicle is provided by United Launch Alliance, Centennial Colorado.(Source: NASA)",

The satellite launched as part of NASA‚Äôs CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) and will conduct groundbreaking scientific study into Earth‚Äôs magnetic field. Once in space, the ANDESITE satellite will initiate measurements of the magnetosphere with onboard sensors, later releasing eight pico satellites carrying small magnetometer sensors to track electric currents flowing in and out of the atmosphere, a phenomenon also known as space weather. These variations in the electrical activity racing through space can have a big impact on our lives here on Earth, causing interruptions to things like radio communications and electrical systems. The ANDESITE satellite follows on from Rocket Lab‚Äôs first ELaNa (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites) launch for NASA, the ELaNa-19 mission, which launched a host of educational satellites to orbit on Electron in December 2018.\n\nThe mission also carried three payloads designed, built and operated by the NRO. The mission was procured under the agency‚Äôs Rapid Acquisition of a Small Rocket (RASR) contract vehicle. RASR allows the NRO to explore new launch opportunities that provide a streamlined, commercial approach for getting small satellites into space, as well as provide those working in the small satellite community with timely and cost-effective access to space. This mission followed Rocket Lab‚Äôs first dedicated mission for the NRO, Birds of a Feather, which was launched on 31 January 2020 NZT from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1.\n\nThe ANDESITE and NRO payloads were joined on the mission by the M2 Pathfinder satellite, a collaboration between the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra Space and the Australian Government. The M2 Pathfinder will test communications architecture and other technologies that will assist in informing the future space capabilities of Australia. The satellite will demonstrate the ability of an onboard software-based radio to operate and reconfigure while in orbit.\n\nThe mission was been named ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äô in recognition of Rocket Lab board member and avid Queen fan Scott Smith, who recently passed away.

The mission lasted six hours during which the second stage ignited four times and went into different orbits to deploy satellites including a 'propulsive passivation maneuver'.\n\nThe side boosters from the Arabsat-6A mission just 2.5 months before were reused on this flight and successfully returned to LZ-1 and LZ-2. The center core, in use for the first time, underwent the most energetic reentry attempted by SpaceX, and attempted a landing over 1,200 km (750 mi) downrange, 30% further than any previous landing. This core suffered a thrust vector control failure in the center engine caused by a breach in the engine bay due to the extreme heat. The core thus failed its landing attempt on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You due to lack of control when the outer engines shut down. For the first time one fairing half was successfully landed on the catch-net of the support ship GO Ms. Tree (formerly Mr. Steven). (Wikipedia)",
