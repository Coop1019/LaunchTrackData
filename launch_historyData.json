        "description": "The Mars 2020 mission with its Perseverance rover is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The Mars 2020 mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key Astrobiology questions about the potential for life on Mars. The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life itself. The Perseverance rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a 'cache' on the surface of Mars. A future mission could potentially return these samples  to Earth.  That would help scientists study the samples in laboratories with special room-sized equipment that would be too large to take to Mars. The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.\n\nThe mission is timed for a launch opportunity in July 2020 when Earth and Mars are in good positions relative to each other for landing on Mars. That is, it takes less power to travel to Mars at this time, compared to other times when Earth and Mars are in different positions in their orbits. To keep mission costs and risks as low as possible, the Mars 2020 design is based on NASA's successful Mars Science Laboratory mission architecture, including its Curiosity rover and proven landing system.\n\nLaunch is still on schedule and the Mars 2020 team is working hard to get the Perseverance rover to the launch pad.  Check the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex for hours and/or any restrictions.  If you plan to attend in person, consider making refundable travel reservations.\n\nThe first launch opportunity begins at 6:35 a.m. PDT/ 9:35 a.m. EDT on July 22\n\nThe launch period is approximately three weeks, from July 22 to August 11. The duration of the daily launch window varies from day to day. The launch windows will last approximately two hours, with a unique launch opportunity every five minutes.\n\nThe Mars 2020 spacecraft with its Perseverance Rover will launch on an Atlas V-541 rocket from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.  The Atlas V is one of the largest rockets available for interplanetary flight.  This is the same type of rocket that launched the InSight and Curiosity to Mars.  The launch vehicle is provided by United Launch Alliance, Centennial Colorado.(Source: NASA)",

More information will be provided as it becomes available.\n(@RocketLab via Twitter)\n\n\nOrignal Mission Objective:\n\n‚ÄòPics Or It Didn‚Äôt Happen‚Äô will deploy seven small satellites to a 500km circular low Earth orbit for a range of customers including Spaceflight Inc.‚Äôs customer Canon Electronics, as well as Planet and In-Space Missions.\n\nThe primary payload aboard this mission, Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs CE-SAT-IB, was procured by satellite rideshare and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc. The mission objective for the CE-SAT-IB satellite is to demonstrate Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs Earth-imaging technology with high-resolution and wide-angle cameras, as well as test the microsatellite for mass production.\n\nThe next five spacecraft manifested for this mission are the latest generation of SuperDove satellites manufactured by Planet, operator of the world‚Äôs largest constellation of Earth-observation satellites. Planet‚Äôs satellites are capable of imaging the Earth‚Äôs entire landmass on a near-daily basis. This unprecedented dataset helps researchers, students, businesses and governments discover patterns, detect early signals of change, and make timely, informed decisions. These five SuperDoves, Flock 4e, are equipped with new sensors to enable higher image quality with sharper, more vibrant colors and accurate surface reflectance values for advanced algorithms and time-series analysis.\n\nThe final spacecraft aboard Electron for this mission has been supplied by British small mission prime, In-Space Missions. The Faraday-1 6U CubeSat is a hosted payload mission providing a low-cost route to orbit for start-ups, institutions, and large corporate R&D groups.  In addition, it provides a first flight demonstration of In-Space‚Äôs own software-defined payload that will enable uploadable payload capabilities on future missions\n\n(Source: Rocket Lab)",

           "description": "'Don't Stop Me Now' was a rideshare mission that launched several small satellites, including the ANDESITE (Ad-Hoc Network Demonstration for Extended Satellite-Based Inquiry and Other Team Endeavors) satellite created by electrical and mechanical engineering students and professors at Boston University. The satellite launched as part of NASA‚Äôs CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) and will conduct groundbreaking scientific study into Earth‚Äôs magnetic field. Once in space, the ANDESITE satellite will initiate measurements of the magnetosphere with onboard sensors, later releasing eight pico satellites carrying small magnetometer sensors to track electric currents flowing in and out of the atmosphere, a phenomenon also known as space weather. These variations in the electrical activity racing through space can have a big impact on our lives here on Earth, causing interruptions to things like radio communications and electrical systems. The ANDESITE satellite follows on from Rocket Lab‚Äôs first ELaNa (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites) launch for NASA, the ELaNa-19 mission, which launched a host of educational satellites to orbit on Electron in December 2018.\n\nThe mission also carried three payloads designed, built and operated by the NRO. The mission was procured under the agency‚Äôs Rapid Acquisition of a Small Rocket (RASR) contract vehicle. RASR allows the NRO to explore new launch opportunities that provide a streamlined, commercial approach for getting small satellites into space, as well as provide those working in the small satellite community with timely and cost-effective access to space. This mission followed Rocket Lab‚Äôs first dedicated mission for the NRO, Birds of a Feather, which was launched on 31 January 2020 NZT from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1.\n\nThe ANDESITE and NRO payloads were joined on the mission by the M2 Pathfinder satellite, a collaboration between the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra Space and the Australian Government. The M2 Pathfinder will test communications architecture and other technologies that will assist in informing the future space capabilities of Australia. The satellite will demonstrate the ability of an onboard software-based radio to operate and reconfigure while in orbit.\n\nThe mission was been named ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äô in recognition of Rocket Lab board member and avid Queen fan Scott Smith, who recently passed away.
