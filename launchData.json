The mission will deploy a total of 10 satellites to precise and individual orbits from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand.\n\nPlanet has nine of their latest generation SuperDove satellites booked on the mission for deployment to a 500km morning-crossing Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO). Each of the nine SuperDoves will be integrated with and deployed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Maxwell dispensers, the industry‚Äôs lightest CubeSat dispenser in its class. Planet‚Äôs Flock 4e‚Äô of SuperDoves will join the company‚Äôs constellation of Earth-observation satellites already on orbit providing medium-resolution global coverage and near-daily revisit.\n\nThe 10th and final payload, Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs CE-SAT-IIB, was arranged by satellite rideshare and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc. CE-SAT-IIB is a technical demonstration microsatellite developed by Canon Electronics Inc. It has a middle-size telescope equipped with an ultra-high sensitivity camera to take night images of the Earth and small size telescopes which are suitable for CubeSat use.\n (Source: Rocket Lab)",
